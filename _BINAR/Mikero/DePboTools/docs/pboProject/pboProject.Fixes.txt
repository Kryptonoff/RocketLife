-----------------
min dll is 5.8x
-----------------
1.98

	fixed bisign filename (credit TeTet)
	fixed addons in addons config.cpp error (credit eggbeast)
1.98
	now removes all instances of pbo in mod folder. ifa,xbo,pbo,zbo,ebo, bisign. previously only pbo & bisign garanteed to be removed before packing.
	non ofp2-man skeleton rtm files are now checked properly
1.97 credit dahlgren
	failed to return bads status in command line mode (headless server) for some aspects of wrp checking
	addon paths when making maps are now truncated to the first folder specified
	previously, it was a comma,separated, paths to check.
	now it's a single path to the cfgworlds config if that config is not adjacent to the wrp
1.96
made dos screen more legible
fixed error in mod.cpp creation
unknown p3d types subject to warnings are errors when creating land classes for wrps. This is only useful for free tools. the pro tools will always keep up to date
striplog now works on wrps too
1.95 (credit dedmen)
	changed wrp requirement to path-to-config when cfgWorlds.whatever is not adjacent to wrp
	added check for binarise producing warnings or errors. neither stop processing
	a binlog is now ALWAYS produced, whether noisy or otherwise
	cutscenes in this pbo, not permitted if warnings are errors
	crippled binarise to never ever 'see' a config.cpp 
	fixed rtm checking to account for rtms AND p3d's

1.94: 
	fixed wrongness in -Mod= syntax now works as documented
	fixed 'workspace' alteration

1.93
	fixed cfgWorlds detection
1.92 resolved land classes by letting binarise look in places other than current project, AND, declaring
	class land_xx;//extern in purpose built config
	gives warning or error messge if cfgworlds is not in adjacent config (for forest generation)

1.91 4 spooky
	reverted to map search paths for land classes
1.90 striplog not used for wrp packing
	added land class detection for streetlamps and towers
	added a landlog for wrp crunching (via the view button)
	ingored binarise status return (other than printing it)
1.89 fixed collision between +Mod= and -Mission
	was formerly +Mission which crapped out Ace python scripts
1.88
added flashwindow to alert job completion
moved crunch button out of the way and made it BIGGER

1.87 fixed roadslib.cfg

1.86 added -noLogs to binarise command line if NOT noisy crunching
1.85 'proper' release of 1.83
1.84 emergency patch to 1.83 to stop potentially corrupted p3d's
1.83
	
	binlogs: potential button click error when trying to view
			 striplog.bat is back in action with the new log	
	model.cfgs: externs are now checked for validity
	nameofmodel.cfg is checked that a p3d exists for it in same folder
	p3d: auto fixes the standard trailing space error (and some others)
	rtm: clash of different skeletons now detected (bis can't binarise them in same pbo)

1.82
	now detects inheritence mistmatches in master and child model.cfg's
	added information message as to which skeleton is being used for unbinarised rtm

1.81
	view binlog is back in business. only took bis 3 years to fix it.
1.80
	rewrote land class generation to account for a pre-ixisting cfgVehicles class. see the readme for nitty gritty

1.79
	forced (and greyed out) compression box if obfuscating to make it more obvious
1.78
corrections for binary p3ds to temp if wrp is being built

1.77
expandable setup panel to see all compression lists or full filenames


wrp map builds:
	pboProject automatically forces binarise to bake in all land classes
	scanning of the pdrive is no longer required.
	wrp force rebuilt
	folder exlusions now supported (part of the dll)

1.76
copy of dscreatekey no longer provided, either it;s been properly installed in a2, or it hasn;t
i would have had to provide dsCheckFiles too and didn't. 
supplying an arma2 dscreatekey was dangerous for any upgrades in a3 anyway

crippled binlog stripping (striplog.bat) as being useless for a3 and causes timing collisions with multiple instances of pboProject

removed binlog viewing for a3 as useless and causes confusion. There's no useful info in that file aprat from a large quantity of dashes


1.75 public release
	added more option -switches for command line version -Warnings and -Mission and -Datestamps
1.74
	made missing land classes and trailing spaces in p3d's a warning (default) or an error (set in setup) see -W in makepbo
	separated the setup panel into smaller dialogs. it was getting too large.
	added dos console tracing messages  when errors happen while copying/ crunching to temp (not all were rapify errors)
1.73
gave proper p:\.source message if it's encountered

freebie release: disabled obfuscation selection in gui It was disabled in the dll, but the user was unaware of that.

1.72:
fixed unpleasant bug if binarise crashes where pbo project might too!

1.71
restored persistency to rebuild cfgPatches
fixed bug introduced in 1.70 where cmdline would often not return bad status

1.70
	renamed rebuildreqaddons in setup and documentation to rebuild cfgPatches to be less confusing
	removed persistency of rebuild cfgPatches so that user must force set this paramater on each instantiation
	now continues processing each job rather than stoppin gon the first job where an error has been detected (except wrps, it stops immediately)

1.69
	stopped crash when bad syntax on command line
	added +-R  rebuild reqaddons
	now fails if a texheader should have been created and hasn't been
1.68
	wrp
		full build is forced if any unbinarised p3d's are repacked in same session.
		automatically (re)builds pbos which a wrp uses and they have been detected as stale or not present in temp
1.67	free tools release
1.66
	wrp builds only
		checks p3d's in temp are, in fact, binarised
		checks binarised p3d is a later filedate than the source
1.65
	added option to not binarise (or compress) mission.sqm 
	BUT the resulting text file will be reduced to remove all comments and includes (if any)
	cmdline option is +/-Q

1.64
fixed error in creating a bisprivatekey file
1.63:
fixed del pbo to fail if game is running
added delete all temp and delete all mods buttons

changed initial default startup engine from arrowhead to arma3
tested for a blank source folder for joblists. can only happen as a result ofg changing work drives
added personal copy of dsCreateKey.exe for those installs of arma2 which don't have it or can't be found
	made sure, 'correct' of dsCreateKey version is used based on engine type (they are currently the same)
1.62:
	fixed dos cmdline obfuscate

1.61: improved rapify support
1.60
	improved utf8 filename builds
	now stops if binarise crashes

wrp
	setup->island builds
		now checks that all folders are on same drive
		prevents a drive only, being specified
	
1.59
	reworded to gui to "sign pbo(s)"
	reworded rtm skeleton usage

1.58
changed titlebar to nameof folder being crunched to assist with selecting one, of multiple instances
of pboProject

forced extern references for where legacy versions *might* have it unset in registry

logged command line for makepbo

1.57
subscriber version of 1.56 with all features enabled
1.56
revised mod.cpp
reverted source saving to p:(dot) source
1.55
removed striplog as an option. it's now permanently set but actually irrelevent for a3 builds

restored the moving of source folders back to p:\\(dot)source. read the readme

1.54
minor fix to speed up checking of roadslib cfg
fixed texheaders.bin generation if a spaced path argument
blocked appid being set unless a3 dlc is being produced

a source folder is ignored for all processing, BUT, only one source folder can exist per pbo to be made, each one joblist

source folder now also hidden from view during generation of texheaders.bin

fixed error in checking model.cfg for skeleton names

1.52
better wording if a (dot)source folder is detected and what to do about it after a crash
silently fixed (dot)ignore files after a crash

added jpg to lst of packable files

1.47
update for latest bis binarise
ignores bis binarise error status as being faulty

1.46
correction to the method by which exlcudes are excludes (internal)
too many terrain builder files were appearing in temp. my bad

1.45
provided a (default) exclude list
1.44
fixed 'no wrp' in pbo !!!!

1.43
island builds: now autoscans for land_xx classes by default. manual now optional.
1.42
added obfuscation
1.41
small improvements to potential ctd's before the gui can initialise

improved cli (dos prompt) for bat processing. 


1.40
now accounts for binarised odol p3d's that it cannot decode (version unknown) by ignoring them for file checking purposes
added a timestamp to ending message so that multiple instances can be checked for when last one was completed

1.39
crippled check extern button so that it's permanently forced on. This because ppl were abusing it's use and stating pboProject reported no errors (because they disabled it)

1.38 made compat to dll
1.37
added a jobs completed msg to dos screen when building multiple pbo's to avoid confusion whether processing has finished or not
p3d: now checks integrity of p3d's before further processing

corrected command line version to reflect the proper <workspace>\temp folder NOT the <mod> folder
added (optional) no file datestamps to ensure successive builds of same pbo result in same sha

1.35 
multiple pbo crunching:
	delayed wrp creation(s) until all other PBO types (if any) are made. 
	this because p3d's it might be using need to be packed first

1.34

added a Keys folder to the mod folder and copied the public key used to sign the pbo's

1.33 fix to 1.32 when creating temp folders

1.32
