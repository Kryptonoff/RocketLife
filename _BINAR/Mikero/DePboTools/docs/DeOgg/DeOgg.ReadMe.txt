Deogg.dll is a support dll to depbo.dll it has been introduced as a hopefully one-off to
reduce the payload of the main dll by more than 1 meg


Installation:

Automatic:

The dll comes with it's own self installer which will automatically put it in the same folder as the family of exe's that depend on this dll for their livelihood. 

c:\program files (x86)\Mikero\DePboTools\bin

There is no requirement for this dll to be global (eg system32), if all exe's use their auto installer.
