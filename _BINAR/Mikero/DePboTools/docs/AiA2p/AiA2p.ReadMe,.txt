drag n drop your aia >>>mod<<< folder onto this, OR

aia2p  \where\ever\your\AIA\modFolder\is

----

be warned that extracting aia2p over-writes the ca folder on your p:\ drive (if present)

the contents of aia contains only those models that are usable in arma THREE. it is NOT the equivalent of extracting armaTWO game data
